# MPOSL dotfiles

Collection of personal dotfiles

## Dotfiles as templates

Some of dotfiles may have pattern related with `jinja2` template (python).
Reason of this that in future this can be managed by ansible where those variables
will be replaced with hardcoded values based on operating system.

## Installation

For now please copy file or files to your home directory (`Linux`, `MacOS`)

Please review dotfile - and if you see syntax `{{ some_variable_name }}` please replace it with hardcoded value.
(This is a place holder for future)
